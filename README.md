Creating that Google static webpage was incredible. It took me a total of maybe 6 hours, and twice I had to restart because of sloppy code. It's not perfect, but I am quite happy. Although it was recommended to not look at the developer tools and other work, I had to for a little bit because I was completely lost. However, progress is progress and I learned ALOT about how to effectively use <divs> and how to structure a webpage.

Now this static illumina webpage copy will be my next challenge. Hopefully i'll learn much more html/css.
